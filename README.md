# WPF Tabs Using ListView
This project was created to test using a listview control instead of the tab strip of a tab control to change the active tab.

- The listview control is populated with the list of tabs from the tab control.
- Selecting an item within the listview will change the active tab in the tab control to that tab.
- The header of the tab is displayed in a textblock which is displayed above the tab control.
